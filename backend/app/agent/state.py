# backend/app/agent/state.py
"""
Agent State

Defines the TypedDict used by the LangGraph and re-exports the content
models the agent works with. The actual Pydantic model definitions live
in `app.agent.schemas` so that:
  - `llm_service` can build OpenAI JSON Schemas from a single source, and
  - we avoid circular imports between agent modules and tools.

NOTE:
- The LangGraph in `agent/graph.py` defines its own `GraphState` for wiring.
  This file keeps a compatible state type that other parts of the system
  may import (e.g., repos, API models). Itâ€™s fine for both to coexist.

CHANGELOG (surgical update):
- Add `synopsis: Optional[Synopsis]` alongside existing `category_synopsis`
  to tolerate both keys during hydration/validation. This aligns with places
  that expect a generic `synopsis` while preserving back-compat with
  `category_synopsis`.

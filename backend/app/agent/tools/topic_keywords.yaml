# Versioned, data-driven keyword set for intent & topic-shape hints.
# This file is expected to grow to thousands of entries over time.
# Notes:
# - Tokens can be plain strings (substring match) or objects with {token, weight}.
# - Regex is allowed by wrapping the pattern in /slashes/ (e.g., "/\\bgen[ -]?z\\b/").
# - Keep everything lowercased unless you need case-sensitive regex.

  # Keep existing intents and widen coverage with common paraphrases.
